# phpXperiments
Welcome to my htdocs folder! Here are some of my little projects to learn php (especially with OOP)! As you may have notice, 
I am using Apache Server, ok? So, feel free to dig through my codes and, 
if you want to suggest any changes or suggestions for me to improve as a programmer, please, send me a message!
